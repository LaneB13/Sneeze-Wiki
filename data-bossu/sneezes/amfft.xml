<body>A loud and viseral sneeze, this sneeze can be heard by everyone in a 3ft radius of the person sneezeing. If you sneeze like this often people will ask you if you're ok. Some people who sneeze like this always sneeze a second time which is for sure to get people's atention when you rocket your head forward twice.</body>
